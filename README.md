## Hierarchical ID Based signatures from Cha-Cheon signatures.

Hardened and normal key derivation. Seems like a dilemma. On one hand, you can derive the public keys from XPUB, pretty useful. On the other hand, the private keys are not isolated. If you leak one of them from a hot wallet, it comes from the other hot wallet.


## Setup

```bash
docker build -t hibe .
```

```bash
docker run -it hibe
```
